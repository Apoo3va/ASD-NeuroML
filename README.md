## 📌 Project Overview
**ASD-NeuroML** is a specialized data science project focused on enhancing the accuracy of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) screenings using supervised learning. By analyzing behavioral traits and clinical markers—such as **A1-A10 scores**, age, and family history—this model provides a high-precision tool for identifying potential ASD indicators early in the developmental cycle.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Feature-Driven Classification:** Utilizes behavioral screening scores (AQ-10) and clinical history to predict ASD traits.
* **Imbalance Handling:** Implements techniques to address the "No ASD" vs. "ASD" data skew common in medical datasets.
* **High Interpretability:** Focuses on impactful features like **Age** and **Jaundice** to provide explainable results.
* **Optimized Performance:** Leverages fine-tuned supervised algorithms for maximum precision.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Model Type:** Supervised Learning (Classification)
